### TECH STACK
- MERN (w/hooks) +Dockerized - deployed with Netlify and Heroku

### Repo Rules 
- You cannot approve your own PR - so two pairs of eyes on ALL PRs.
- Write clean code, Code to Spec, write tests(TBD), plan each task first (pseudocode) for example:
```
- DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen, back end story board as well 
```
- Pair code each Isssue if possible leveling up each task, assigned a pair in class or otherwise on Slack
- Use a template or process for creating "Issues" whihc got to "TO DO" and are tracked items in the KANBAN board.

Pattern: Input - process - output  
User story - An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it's valuable to users. Each story is business driven meaning a user benefit
able to illustrate a user story with an example
able to express the acceptance criteria for a user story in terms that will be directly usable as an automated acceptance test
Eliminate unneeded scope - cut out or split up story
