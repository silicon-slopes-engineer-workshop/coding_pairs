# Code With Me  -> Pair coding matcher

- user story - An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it's valuable to users.
1. -- (subject to chagne still) Sign up process for each member creating a profile with basic skills levels, pair coding preferences (work with strong/weak etc.)  
2. -- Upon arrival to a meet up user is to click tasks desried for the day somehow and is matched with another programmer, handle odd group total to pair one group with, this happens only after all present have clicked in so to speak 
- A breakdown of roles by group member. A schedule for completion of various tasks. Use of a PM tool like a Kanban Board of some sort 
1. -- We will do this project by assignemt from organzier and make pairs for each day coding. 
2. -- We will use the built in Github Kanban Boards and Issues 
- DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen, back end story board as well 
1. -- Once a task is assigned, coders will be asked to design layouts, screens(or back end routes) and data flow for a component BEFORE coding

- Build MVP - Start coding in class (on site) next week upon pairing up, discuss possible remote options 

- Phase 2 Stretch Features, Bugs, Enhancements, UI Polishing
1. -- comments/notes, login, security for the API, styling pizazz and custom desgin stuff if desired 
2. -- Some type of history/tracking maybe - like who teh user paired with and what they did etc.
